# Q-Chang Design Tokens

This file contains a list of design token of Q-Chang Design System. <br/>
The goal is to collect all visual styles in one place, ensuring consistency across all Q-Chang products.

<b>For Devloper</b><br/>
Use a token name to create variables for each platform (Swift, XML, SASS, etc.). 
When all platforms use the same token name, that helps to better communication around design.

<b>For Designer</b><br/>
To define a token name, make a decision, and ensure consistency and correctness throughout the Figma library and this file.

For more detail and visualize, please see Q-Chang Figma team.
